# fresh.ly
The fresh.ly fantasy console, built on Fresh.

*fresh.ly* is a fantasy console inspired by [pico-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php). Like pico-8, it comes to you as a game development app that you run on Windows, Mac, or Linux in order to create your own games. Like pico-8, it enables you to publish your game to any of these platforms plus iOS, Android, or a web player. Like pico-8, it is intended for small, focused, limited games. Like pico-8, your game code is written in Lua, using many of the same commands as those found in pico-8.

Unlike pico-8, *fresh.ly* has no fixed palette or screen size. It allows you to use your own sound effects and music generated in other sound effect tools (cfxr, GarageBand, etc.). *fresh.ly* has no built-in editing abilities. You create your sprite sheet in your own art tools (e.g. Photoshop, Piskel) and do all map editing within the [Tiled map editor](https://www.mapeditor.org).

*fresh.ly* has a fairly rich virtual CRT shader that enables you to make your game look like it's being played on an old TV or monitor.

If you enjoy the simplicity and immediacy of pico-8 for creating your games but crave more flexibility and power, *fresh.ly* is a good choice.
